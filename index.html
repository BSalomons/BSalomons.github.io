  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to outline the core functions of Salomons Commercial’s website and application
    (“<strong>App</strong>”).</p>
  <p>Salomons Commercial is a full service commercial real estate brokerage specializing in the Central Alberta region
    only (the “<strong>Area</strong>”). Our brokerage works with both sellers/landlords and buyers/tenants. The primary
    relationships we have are with our seller and landlord clients through our listing contracts to market and
    sell/lease their commercial real estate.</p>
  <p>The App serves two purposes:
  <ol>
    <li>the frontend website that the public visits, and</li>
    <li>the backend database that both populates the frontend and stores transactional and property data on any
      commercial property in the Area.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Our current App is written in Python using the Django framework for the backend. The frontend is built on top using
    the Wagtail framework. The backend has an API setup with our Salesforce account to use Salesforce as an external
    database through a one-way push sync; any record input on the backend will overwrite any data in the fields that are
    synced with Salesforce. The backend also utilizes GIS packages to integrate polygons overlaid on a satellite map
    (currently Mapbox). These polygon GIS files were purchased from a government database (<a
      href="https://www.altalis.com/" target="_blank">https://www.altalis.com/</a>) that comes from Alberta’s Land
    Titles system.</p>
  <p>The frontend’s primary purpose is to list and display the information on our Listings on the /property page and the
    vast majority of our traffic goes through this page and the children pages (ie specific listings). Other supporting
    purposes of the frontend is to describe what we do, who we are, what projects we have completed, a blog, and how to
    contact us.</p>
  <p>The UX needs to allow users to find and search properties that meet their criteria easily and quickly. Our current
    frontend used AirBnB’s website as inspiration for the filters and display of records. This has the various filters
    on the left hand side, the records listed inline in the middle, and the location of each property on an interactive
    map on the right hand side. As filters are applied, the records and the map are updated accordingly.</p>
