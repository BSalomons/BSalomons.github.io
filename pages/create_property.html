<p>A Property represents anything that has a certificate of title. Most of the time it is the piece of land but the one exception are condominiums. If it has a title, then there needs to be its own Property record. A Listing can only have one Property record associated with it.</p>

<p>The Property is the highest parent record which can have further child records below it. What this means is that a child record can&rsquo;t exist unless the parent does. You can&rsquo;t have a building with out a piece of land to put it on. You also can&rsquo;t have a Premises within a building. Therefore, the Property is a parent of a Building record which is the parent to the Premises record (Property is the grandparent). You need to create the parent records first (and save it to the Database) before you can add and associate the child records with it.</p>

<p>If you have checked and are sure the Property does not exist in the Database already, then follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="checklist-1">
  <li>Navigate to the Property page</li>
  <li>Click either one of the Record Types at the top (Add Office, Add Industrial, &hellip;.) or click the green &ldquo;Add Property&rdquo; button. The difference between the two is the top categories will choose the record type chosen whereas the green button will just load the blank form and a record type will then need to be selected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Complete the fields within the form. The fields needing explaining are below, obvious ones are not included:</p>

<label class="container">Property Name
  <input type="checkbox">
  <span class="checkmark"></span>
</label>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the Address for the Property</li>
      <li>4909 50 Street</li>
      <li><strong>Must follow this nomenclature</strong></li>
    </ul>
  <label class="container">Record Type
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose the applicable Record Type</li>
      <li>If multiple uses, choose the best or most applicable</li>
      <li><strong>This field is used with the filters on the front end of the website </strong>so if this is not chosen correctly then people won&rsquo;t see it. Think about how you would classify it if you were a user on the front end</li>
    </ul>

<p class="save">At this point, click the &ldquo;Save and Continue Editing&rdquo; button on the right-hand side before proceeding as the Record Type changes what the form looks like depending on selection.</p>

<label class="container">Secondary Use
  <input type="checkbox">
  <span class="checkmark"></span>
</label>
    <ul>
      <li>Use this picklist to choose other uses for the site</li>
      <li>For example if Land was chosen for the Record Type, then choose what kind of Land</li>
      <li>If the Property can be used for Office but is primarily Retail, then add Office</li>
      <li><strong>Do not use this unless necessary. We don&rsquo;t want every property falling under every category. Just because office can go into a retail mall doesn&rsquo;t mean it should be included here. If you are on the front end and you select Office, that means you are looking for Office, not a Retail space. </strong></li>
    </ul>
  <label class="container">Zone
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
    <ul>
      <li>This should be zoning so select the correct zoning for the property by typing what it is.</li>
      <li>There is the off chance it doesn&rsquo;t exist, if so <a href="../pages/add_zoning.html">click here</a> to add it to the Database</li>
    </ul>
  <label class="container">Municipality
    <input type="checkbox">

  <span class="checkmark"></span>
</label>

      <li>Add the LINC number that is found in the top left corner of the title</li>
      <li>You must add the leading zeros and it must be 10 digits long</li>
      <li>This is a unique number and no two properties can have the same LINC number at the Land Titles Office</li>
      <li>The Existing Parcel checkbox is enabled by default. Do not uncheck this unless the property is proposed and hasn&rsquo;t been created yet. Ie needs to be subdivided</li>

      <li>Zoom in, pan and move the map to place the pin in the correct spot then click the mouse</li>
    </ul>

<p class="save">At this point, click the &ldquo;Save and Continue Editing&rdquo; button on the right-hand side before proceeding.</p>

<p>If just Land, then the Property is complete. If there are buildings on the site, then complete the Building form below. Even though it falls under the Property page, this technically is its own class of records; we have just embedded the form within the Property page to make it easier for data input (same with Premises).</p>

<p><a href="../pages/add_building.html">Click here</a> on how to Add a Building</p>

<p>The Building information <strong>must</strong> be completed. The fields under &ldquo;Site Information&rdquo; are calculated based on the values entered for the Buildings and the front end filters use these values. Therefore, if there are two buildings then the total Site Rentable Area is the sum of the two building&rsquo;s rentable areas (ditto with the other fields).</p>

<p>The Building information <strong>must</strong> be completed first prior to completing any Premises information. This is because the Building record is parent to the Premises child record (a Premises can&rsquo;t exist without the Building).</p>
