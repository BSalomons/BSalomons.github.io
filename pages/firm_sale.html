  <p>Once conditions have been waived and satisfied for a deal transaction, the following steps <strong>must</strong> be followed immediately.</p>

  <p><a href="#lease">Click Here</a> to jump down to the <b>Lease</b> section</p>

  <h2 class="anchor-title">Sale</h2>

  <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>

  <p>In the unlikely event you happen to write an unconditional offer that is accepted by the seller, follow the steps for a Pending Deal except the Status field will be marked as &ldquo;In Contract&rdquo; and you won&rsquo;t need to enter the conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>At this stage, it is very important to check that the data entered while it was &ldquo;Pending&rdquo; is still accurate.</strong></p>

  <h3>Updating a Pending Offer to In Contract:</h3>

  <p>Conditions have been waived and the transaction is proceeding to closing. The <u>In Contract</u> record <strong>must</strong> be double checked that applicable deal terms are still accurate. Amendments or other changes may have occurred to the deal subsequent to the initial acceptance.</p>

  <p>The following fields <strong>must</strong> <strong>be checked and updated</strong> <strong>by the agent</strong> once an &ldquo;In Contract&rdquo; deal occurs:</p>

  <label class="container">Status
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the Status from &ldquo;Pending&rdquo; to &ldquo;In Contract&rdquo;</li>
    <li>When the save button is hit, emails will be sent out to the broker and admin staff</li>
    <li>When the save button is hit, all the conditions that were listed will be marked as complete and, if the condition removal date was not entered, it will be marked with todays date.</li>
  </ul>

  <label class="container">Contract Price
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure this price is still accurate as it may have changed from an amendment</li>
  </ul>

  <label class="container">Closing Date
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure this date is entered correctly</li>
    <li>If unknown, use your best estimate or worst-case scenario</li>
  </ul>

  <label class="container">Project Contacts
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Since deposits and correspondence will be sent to both lawyers and the brokers, make sure their addresses and contact information is accurate.</strong> The fields below the party&rsquo;s names is what is associated with that person. If blank, then nothing is inputted.</li>
  </ul>

  <label class="container">Commission Amount
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure this is still accurate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="save">At this point, click the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button that will be hovering at the bottom of the page before proceeding.</p>
  
  <p>The remainder of the record should be updated by the agent to ensure its accuracy. The following explains the various &ldquo;Related Lists&rdquo; associated with the <u>In Contract</u> record.</p>

  <label class="container">Conditions
    <input type="checkbox">
    <span class="checkmark"></span>
  </label>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the Date Removed is correct</li>

    <li>Make sure this is accurate with the correct allocations</li>
